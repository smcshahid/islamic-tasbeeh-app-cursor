# Alert System Update

## Overview

The prayer times app now features a comprehensive alert system that provides clear, actionable feedback when users encounter boundaries or connectivity issues during navigation.

## Alert Types

### 1. Sample Data Boundaries

#### **End of Month Alert (June 30 → July 1)**
```
Title: "No Next Month Data"
Message: "Next month's prayer times are not available in sample data mode. 
In production, the app would automatically fetch July's data from the server."

Buttons:
- "OK" - Close alert
- "Learn More" - Show production features info
```

#### **Beginning of Month Alert (June 1 → May 31)**
```
Title: "Beginning of Sample Data"
Message: "This is the earliest date available in the sample data. 
In production, the app would fetch previous month's data automatically."

Buttons:
- "OK" - Close alert
```

#### **Wrong Month Alert (June → May/July/etc.)**
```
Title: "Month Not Available"
Message: "[Month] data is not available in sample mode. 
Only June 2025 prayer times are included for demonstration purposes."

Buttons:
- "OK" - Close alert
```

### 2. Production Mode Alerts

#### **Date Range Exceeded**
```
Title: "Date Range Exceeded"
Message: "Prayer times are only available for dates within 1 year from today. 
Please select a date within this range."

Buttons:
- "OK" - Close alert
```

#### **No Internet Connection**
```
Title: "No Internet Connection"
Message: "Internet connection is required to fetch prayer times for new dates. 
Please check your connection and try again."

Buttons:
- "OK" - Close alert
- "Check Connection" - Retry after checking connectivity
```

### 3. Fetch Error Alerts

#### **Network Error**
```
Title: "No Internet Connection"
Message: "Unable to fetch prayer times. Please check your internet connection 
and try again. You can still navigate within the current month using cached data."

Buttons:
- "OK" - Close alert
- "Retry" - Attempt navigation again
```

#### **General Navigation Error**
```
Title: "Navigation Failed"
Message: "Unable to load prayer times: [specific error message]"

Buttons:
- "OK" - Close alert  
- "Retry" - Attempt navigation again
```

## Educational Features

### **Production Features Info**
When users tap "Learn More" on the end-of-month alert:

```
Title: "Production Features"
Message: "In the production version:

• Automatic month fetching
• Offline support for current month  
• Real-time data updates
• Global location support"

Buttons:
- "Got it" - Close info
```

## Technical Implementation

### **Key Features:**

1. **Dynamic Alert Import**: Alerts are imported dynamically to avoid import issues
2. **Context-Level Handling**: All navigation alerts handled in the context, not UI components
3. **Network Monitoring**: Real-time connectivity detection with NetInfo
4. **Smart Retry Logic**: Retry options that recheck connectivity
5. **Educational Content**: Explains production capabilities vs demo limitations

### **Alert Flow:**

```
User Navigation → Boundary/Error Check → Show Alert → User Action → Navigate/Stay
```

### **Network Detection:**

```typescript
// Check connectivity before navigation
const netInfo = await NetInfo.fetch();
if (!netInfo.isConnected) {
  // Show appropriate alert with retry option
}
```
