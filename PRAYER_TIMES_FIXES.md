# Prayer Times Fixes Implementation

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Month Transition Error
**Problem**: When navigating to the next day in prayer times, the app worked until the end of the month, then threw "No prayer times found for the specified date" error instead of gracefully handling month transitions.

**Solution**: Enhanced the `fetchPrayerTimes` function in `PrayerTimesContext.tsx` to:
- Try fetching from the primary month first
- If that fails, attempt to fetch from adjacent months (previous and next)
- Provide user-friendly error messages instead of technical errors
- Handle edge cases gracefully

### 2. Prayer Notification Issues
**Problem**: The app was showing multiple notifications in the notification bar instead of properly scheduling them for today's prayer times only. Notifications should only trigger at the actual prayer times and play the adhan sound.

**Solution**: Completely restructured the notification system in `prayerNotifications.ts`:

#### Key Changes:
- **Today-Only Scheduling**: Notifications are now only scheduled for today's prayers
- **Proper Cleanup**: All existing notifications are cancelled before scheduling new ones
- **Time Adjustments**: Notifications properly handle prayer time adjustments (+/- minutes)
- **Adhan Integration**: Notifications now properly play the selected adhan audio
- **App Restart Handling**: Notifications are re-initialized when the app restarts

#### Implementation Details:

1. **Enhanced Notification Scheduling**:
   - Only schedules notifications for today's date
   - Cancels all existing notifications before creating new ones
   - Handles time adjustments correctly (accounting for hour overflow/underflow)
   - Skips past prayer times to avoid unnecessary notifications

2. **Improved Notification Handler**:
   - Plays the selected adhan audio when notification is received
   - Uses volume and fade-in settings from user preferences
   - Provides proper haptic feedback
   - Logs notification events for debugging

3. **App Initialization**:
   - Added notification service initialization in the root layout
   - Added today's notification initialization in the prayer context
   - Ensures notifications are set up when the app starts

## Files Modified

1. **`src/contexts/PrayerTimesContext.tsx`**:
   - Enhanced `fetchPrayerTimes` with month transition handling
   - Added graceful error messages
   - Limited notification scheduling to today only

2. **`src/utils/prayerNotifications.ts`**:
   - Restructured `scheduleAllNotifications` to handle only today's prayers
   - Enhanced `schedulePrayerNotification` with proper time adjustments
   - Improved `handlePrayerNotification` to play adhan audio
   - Added `initializeTodaysNotifications` for app startup

3. **`app/_layout.tsx`**:
   - Added notification service initialization on app startup
   - Ensures proper initialization before showing the app

## Expected Behavior

### Month Navigation:
- Smooth navigation between months without errors
- User-friendly error messages if data is unavailable
- Automatic fallback to adjacent months when needed

### Prayer Notifications:
- Only today's prayer notifications appear in the notification bar
- Notifications trigger at the exact prayer times (with adjustments)
- Adhan plays automatically when notification is received
- Notifications are properly cleaned up and re-initialized on app restart
- No duplicate or old notifications accumulate

## Testing

To test the fixes:

1. **Month Transition**: Navigate through days using the next/previous buttons, especially around month boundaries
2. **Notifications**: 
   - Enable prayer notifications in settings
   - Restart the app and check that only today's prayers are scheduled
   - Wait for a prayer time to test adhan playback
   - Verify that no duplicate notifications appear

## Security Considerations

- All notification data is validated before processing
- Audio playback is controlled through secure audio service
- User preferences are properly stored and retrieved
- Error handling prevents app crashes from notification issues
