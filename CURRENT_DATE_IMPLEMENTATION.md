# Current Date Implementation

## Overview

The prayer times app now uses the actual current date mapped to June 2025 sample data, providing a realistic demo experience that changes daily.

## How It Works

### Date Mapping Logic

```typescript
const getInitialDate = (): string => {
  if (isSampleDataMode()) {
    // Use actual current date but map to June 2025 for sample data
    const today = new Date();
    const currentDay = today.getDate();
    const currentMonth = today.getMonth() + 1; // 0-based, so add 1
    
    // Map current date to June 2025 for demo
    let demoDay: number;
    if (currentMonth === 6) {
      // We're in June, use actual day
      demoDay = Math.min(currentDay, 30); // Cap at 30 since our sample data goes to June 30
    } else {
      // Not June, use day within 1-30 range based on current day
      demoDay = ((currentDay - 1) % 30) + 1;
    }
    
    return `2025-06-${demoDay.toString().padStart(2, '0')}`;
  }
  return new Date().toISOString().split('T')[0];
};
```

### User Experience Examples

**Today (June 27, 2024):**
- App opens showing "Today" with June 27, 2025 prayer times
- Next prayer shows real countdown based on current time
- Navigation buttons work forward/backward from June 27

**Tomorrow (June 28, 2024):**
- App opens showing "Today" with June 28, 2025 prayer times
- Seamless progression through the month

**When reaching boundaries:**
- June 30 → July 1: Shows error message, stays on June 30
- June 1 → May 31: Shows error message, stays on June 1

## Key Features

### 1. Real-Time Date Mapping
- ✅ Uses actual current date (June 27)
- ✅ Maps to June 2025 sample data (June 27, 2025)
- ✅ Updates automatically each day

### 2. Dynamic Labels
- ✅ "Today" for current mapped date
- ✅ "Tomorrow" for next day
- ✅ "Yesterday" for previous day
- ✅ Full date format for other days

### 3. Boundary Handling
- ✅ June 1-30 range enforced
- ✅ Clear error messages at boundaries
- ✅ No crashes or broken states
- ✅ User-friendly explanations

### 4. Next Prayer Display
- ✅ Shows only for "Today" 
- ✅ Real-time countdown using actual current time
- ✅ Hidden for past/future dates

### 5. Prayer Time Status
- ✅ "Passed", "Next", "Upcoming" indicators
- ✅ Only shown for today's date
- ✅ Based on real current time

## Sample Data Coverage

### Realistic Variations
Prayer times change realistically throughout June based on UK summer solstice patterns:

- **Fajr**: Gets earlier until June 21 (solstice), then slightly later
- **Dhuhr**: Minimal changes (solar noon)
- **Asr**: Gets progressively later throughout month
- **Maghrib**: Gets later until solstice, then earlier
- **Isha**: Follows maghrib pattern with smaller variations

### Hijri Date Progression
- Proper Islamic calendar mapping
- June 1 = 5 Dhū al-Ḥijjah 1446 AH
- Continues sequentially through the month

## Navigation Behavior

### Within Sample Range (June 1-30, 2025)
```
June 26 ← June 27 (Today) → June 28
          ↓
     Smooth navigation with realistic prayer times
```

### At Boundaries
```
June 30 → [Next] → Error: "Latest date available in sample data"
June 1 ← [Prev] ← Error: "Earliest date available in sample data"
```

### Error Messages
- **June 30 boundary**: "This is the latest date available in the sample data. In production, the app would fetch next month's data automatically."
- **June 1 boundary**: "This is the earliest date available in the sample data."
- **Wrong year**: "Sample data is only available for 2025."
- **Wrong month**: "Sample data is only available for June 2025."

## Benefits

1. **Natural User Experience**
   - App behavior matches real-world expectations
   - Today always shows "Today", tomorrow shows "Tomorrow"
   - Prayer times update realistically each day

2. **Demonstration Value**
   - Shows how app would work in production
   - Realistic prayer time variations
   - Proper Islamic calendar integration

3. **Error Resilience**
   - Clear boundaries and error messages
   - No crashes when reaching limits
   - User understands demo limitations

4. **Development Efficiency**
   - Single sample dataset covers full month
   - Automatic generation of realistic variations
   - Easy to test different scenarios

## Implementation Notes

### Context Updates
- Enhanced state management with `currentDate` tracking
- Smart month-based caching with boundary checks
- Real-time next prayer calculations

### UI Updates
- Dynamic date formatting with relative labels
- Today button navigates to actual mapped current date
- Next prayer info only shown for today

### Sample Data Updates
- Realistic prayer time variations throughout June
- Proper solstice-based calculations for UK location
- Comprehensive error handling for invalid dates

This implementation provides a seamless, realistic demo experience that changes daily while maintaining clear boundaries and error handling for the sample data limitations.
