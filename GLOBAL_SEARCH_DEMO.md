## Technical Implementation

### Search Algorithm
- **Keyword matching**: Searches titles, subtitles, and predefined keywords
- **Fuzzy search**: Finds partial matches (e.g., "pray" matches "prayer")
- **Dynamic content**: Includes user's actual counter names and current values
- **Context-aware**: Shows current setting values in results

### Navigation System
- **Screen routing**: Uses Expo Router for navigation
- **Action triggers**: Some results trigger specific actions (modals, functions)
- **State management**: Integrates with existing app contexts
- **Accessibility**: Full screen reader and keyboard navigation support

### Performance Optimizations
- **Memoized search results**: Efficient filtering and rendering
- **Lazy loading**: Search results calculated on-demand
- **Debounced input**: Smooth typing experience
- **Memory efficient**: Cleans up state when modal closes
